--------

This version is a clone of the 2.25.21 version that exists on Splunkbase as of this writing. I have added a single lookup table that provides
additional context to all System Log events, along with an automatic lookup. Each event now contains a series of tags, a plain-text description,
and a categorization of "security" or "admin" interest.

A dashboard is also provided to investigate this newly enriched data.

Specifically, an automated lookup adds the following fields to the sourcetype OktaIM2:log:

admin_interest: Events that should be of interest to Okta administrators (boolean)
security_interest: Events that should be of interest to security audiences, e.g. SOC or operations (boolean)
event_type_description: Plain-text description of event, pulled from https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/event-types/ (string)
event_type_tags: Event type tags in pipe-delimited format, pulled from same URL as above (string)
release_note_date: Date that this event was released in the System Log API, pulled from same URL as above (string)
smushed_event_type: Not terribly useful, actually

The dashboard "Admin & Security Log Explorer" is provided as an example way to leverage this data. It allows slicing-and-dicing of System Log data
based on the Admin, Security, and Tag enrichments mentioned above.
